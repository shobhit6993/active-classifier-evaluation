Things that might differ in implementation on real classifiers
- predict function
    + in simulation, predict takes as arg the target (gold label)
    + in real classifier, predict function will take as arg the item

- keep or remove num_seed?

- vectorize code for get max disgreement and top disagreement
- bug in code for the case when num_clf is a multiple of num_classes
- memory issues
